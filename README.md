# LeetCodeSolutions
A collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems, documenting my journey to improve my problem-solving and algorithm skills. 

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered:
- **Arrays & Strings**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Trees**
- **Backtracking**
  
### Always included: 
- A brielf description of the problem and my approach to solving it.
- **Time complexity** and **space complexity** analysis.
- My **thought process** throughout the solution
- The blood, sweat, and tears it took me to get there. (Okay, maybe not literal tears, but definitely some caffeine-induced moments of despair.)

### Sometimes included:
- A brief explanation of **why I liked the problem**, especially it it required a unique solution.
- What I learned from a problem, a use of an algorithm I had not yet used, or was used creatively.
